# This is conceptual - the actual hianime package uses internal scraping
# You cannot directly curl the anime streaming sites due to anti-bot measures

# The hianime npm package handles:
# 1. Bypassing cloudflare protection
# 2. Extracting embed links
# 3. Decrypting video sources
# 4. Returning clean m3u8 URLs
