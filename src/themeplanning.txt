# Theme Architecture Planning

## Structure
- src/themes/{theme}/pages/ - Theme-specific page implementations
- src/themes/{theme}/components/ - Theme-specific components (future)
- src/shared/ - Shared logic, types, and hooks
- src/components/ - Shared, theme-agnostic components

## Current Status
✅ Theme routing infrastructure complete
✅ Placeholder pages created for both themes
✅ Shared types and hooks established
🔄 Currently wrapping existing Landing page for both themes
📋 Next: Create distinct UI implementations per theme

## Architecture Benefits
- Complete UI flexibility per theme
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Better code organization
- Lazy loading for performance
- Shared business logic via hooks

## Next Steps
1. Gradually create theme-specific components
2. Migrate shared components to theme-specific versions
3. Implement unique layouts per theme
4. Add theme-specific animations and interactions
