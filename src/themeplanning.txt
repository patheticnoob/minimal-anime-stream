Retro Theme Implementation Plan
===============================

Goal
----
Deliver a selectable “Retro Home Screen” theme inspired by CRT-era UI with:
- Minimal grid background, soft glow edges, and scanline overlays.
- Dotted matrix typography for titles plus mono body copy.
- Retro-futuristic buttons, cards, and hero layout accents.
- Theme persistence using the existing Convex-backed theme system.

Work Breakdown
--------------
1. Theme Foundation
   - Define retro-focused CSS variables (palette, neon accents, radii).
   - Import DotGothic16 + Space Mono to mimic matrix lettering.
   - Create layered background (gradient + grid + scanlines) and global typography overrides.

2. Visual Treatments
   - Build neon panel styling for hero, sidebar, and modal shells.
   - Add scanline/vignette overlays, glowing borders, and hover pulses.
   - Normalize button/input styles to uppercase mono text with neon borders.

3. Component Styling
   - Hero: grid overlay, softened art edge, neon buttons, uppercase copy.
   - Cards/Rails: holographic hover, wireframe borders, retro progress accents.
   - Info modal + sidebar: translucent panels with glowing edges.

4. Integration
   - Import the retro stylesheet via `src/index.css`.
   - Expose “Retro Home Screen” in the theme dropdown, persisting via existing mutations.
   - Keep “classic” as the default to avoid regressions.

5. QA & Polish
   - Toggle between themes to ensure overrides are scoped and responsive.
   - Verify readability, hover states, and that classic remains unchanged.
   - Gather feedback for additional retro-specific micro-interactions if needed.
